With this, not only have the doors been\n          thrown open for women to gain permanent commission in the Indian Army,\n          Air Force and Navy, the decision has long-term ramifications regarding\n          the future of women in the armed forces.\n        </p>\n        <p class="text-white mt-2">\n          At present, women are recruited in the defence services as short\n          service commission officers. On March 17, 2020, the Supreme Court\n          ordered women officers to be given the same option of converting their\n          short service commission to permanent commission—as given to male\n          officers.\n        </p>\n        <p class="text-white mt-2">\n          The first batch of women officers was given commission in the Navy in\n          1992. It has taken close to 30 years for women to be given direct\n          permanent commission. Commander Prasanna Edayilliam (retired), the\n          first woman officer from the Indian Navy to challenge the denial of\n          permanent commission to women officers in court in 2010, welcomed the\n          decision. “If a woman clears the NDA written test, the physical test\n          and outdoor training imparted at the NDA, she ought to be treated at\n          par with the men who accomplish the same,” she said. “The idea is to\n          groom someone from a young age. A young male is not born an admiral.\n          If the same opportunities are given to women, I suppose in 30 years\n          from now, India could have its first woman Navy chief.”\n        </p>\n        <p class="text-white mt-2">\n          To understand what gaining entry into the defence services through the\n          NDA means, a look at the various options for entry would be pertinent.\n          The NDA recruits personnel right after leaving school. Another mode of\n          entry is through the Combined Defence Services (CDS) exam, which is\n          meant for graduates. Commissions through both channels are permanent.\n          Besides, there is a permanent commission for those who have done their\n          post-graduation, which is usually for engineers, electronics and\n          mechanical engineers (EMEs), judge and advocate general (JAGs),\n          signals, army educational corps (AECs), etc. The Officer Training\n          Academy (OTA) in Chennai and Gaya recruits short service commission\n          officers, both men and women. This is presently the only entry option\n          available for women.\n        </p>\n        <p class="text-white mt-2">\n          While recruits and trainees of all academies are at par, on paper,\n          once they have passed out, it is the NDA near Pune that is considered\n          the elite institution among them. At present, the top positions in the\n          army, navy and air force are usually manned by NDA recruits. The\n          reason is simple. NDA recruits have an advantage as their entry age is\n          between 16.5 and 19. In defence services, where retirement age is tied\n          to the rank held, the youngest in a batch have a very clear benefit.\n        </p>\n        <p class="text-white mt-2">\n          While the nuts and bolts of recruitment of women officers through the\n          NDA is to be worked out, what is clear is that women will get\n          permanent commission and, as a result, commission in what are called\n          ‘Arms’ or the main fighting unit. Promotions in the army also depend\n          on the formation the officer hails from. In the case of the army,\n          being from the infantry, artillery or armoured corps holds an\n          advantage in promotions as there are more vacancies within the\n          formation for officers to rise up the chain. Also, top positions of\n          corps commanders or army commanders, and finally the chief, are almost\n          always held by those from the ‘Arms’. Gaining entry into the fighting\n          arms will put women in the reckoning for all top positions in the\n          army. “That is a possibility in the future. Once the commission is\n          permanent, all roles are open for women,” says Vice Admiral Suresh\n          Bangara (retired), a former commandant of the NDA.\n        </p>\n        <p class="text-white mt-2">\n          How will the NDA prepare itself for this historic decision? “The\n          Supreme Court saw the issue from the point of equality. Adjustments\n          will have to be made in physical infrastructure for women when they\n          arrive at the NDA. Already, with enhanced induction levels, the number\n          of squadrons of trainees has been increased,” says Bangara.\n        </p>\n        <p class="text-white mt-2">\n          The three service chiefs visited the NDA on August 20 to take stock of\n          the situation and prepare the academy for the arrival of women as\n          trainees on its premises.\n        </p>\n        <p class="text-white mt-2">\n          Even in the west, where women officers in the navy have been given\n          command of battleships, the new ships being built are designed in a\n          way that they have women-specific amenities. “Some modifications may\n          need to be done. But if women have gone to space and conquered Mount\n          Everest, these changes can be easily made to facilitate them,” said\n          Prasanna. It is not clear yet how many women will make it to the NDA\n          after the written test and other formalities to be held November\n          onwards. “Most importantly, we do not want any reservation for entry.\n          We want the same training, the same merit as men. There can then be no\n          denial of higher commands for women,” she added.\n        </p>',

    '<h2 class="text-4xl font-semibold text-white">\n          Want to Learn "The BEST Way to prepare for NDA Written Exam?"\n        </h2>\n        <img src="../images/blog2.jpg" class="w-5/6 mt-10" alt="" />\n        <div class="flex items-start mt-4 items-center">\n          <div\n            class="\n              w-10\n              h-10\n              p-px\n              rounded-full\n              bg-gradient-to-r\n              from-yellow-500\n              to-pink-500\n            "\n          >\n            <img src="../student.jpg" class="w-full rounded-full" alt="" />\n          </div>\n\n          <div class="text-white">\n            <h4 class="px-2">Manoj Kumar</h4>\n            <h4 class="px-2 text-sm">24/08/2021</h4>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p class="text-white mt-4">\n          The First and Foremost thing you should understand is that NDA written\n          Exam is VERY EASY to clear if you plan for it properly. You might have\n          come across “NDA written is very TOUGH to crack” “It’s not everyone’s\n          cup of tea“, etc. This is all Bullshit. THESE statements are made\n          either by people/websites/blogs those who want to sell their\n          Books/Course Materials/Courses/Advertisements,etc or by people who\n          have either never ever appeared for NDA exam or have never cleared the\n          exam.\n        </p>\n        <p class="text-white mt-4">\n          You might find above mentioned statement very BOLD but its very true.\n          Let me prove it to you, Try to find information of candidates who have\n          cleared the NDA written exam, he might be your friend, your friend’s\n          friend, neighbour, senior, etc. Ask them their 10th and 12th Board\n          Exam percentage, you will be surprised to find maximum of the students\n          will be from 55% – 75% category. Students from lower or upper\n          percentage bracket may also have cleared the exam but majority comes\n          from this bracket. If the N.D.A written Exam is so TOUGH, then how on\n          earth from last so many years 55% or 60% students are clearing the\n          written exam. The only reason I can find is, other than having Desire\n          and Dream to join NDA and they put in right efforts and right planning\n          in place to do so.\n        </p>\n        <p class="text-white mt-4">In first 2 para’s, I made 2 points clear:</p>\n        <ul class="text-white mt-2">\n          <li>\n            1. NDA written exam is easy to clear if you plan for it properly.\n          </li>\n          <li>2. Anyone can clear the exam</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p class="text-white mt-4">\n          If you are looking for points, how to prepare for N.D.A Exam, you can\n          click here. But this article is about finding the Best way to prepare\n          for NDA written Exam.\n        </p>\n        <p class="text-white mt-4">\n          How i see it, I find 3 ways to prepare for N.D.A written exam\n        </p>\n        <ul class="text-white mt-2">\n          <li>1. Self Preparation</li>\n          <li>2. Join any coaching class.</li>\n          <li>3. Join C.D.C.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <div class="mt-8 pl-4">\n          <h3 class="text-yellow-500 font-semibold">Self Preparation:</h3>\n          <p class="text-white mt-2">\n            This is one of the good way to prepare. But the commitment level\n            required is very high as you have to maintain the same consistency\n            for nearly 2 years. On an average student who self prepares for the\n            exam Buy one good book and try to finish that book before the exam\n            i.e. prepares from that same book. Biggest challenges faced by such\n            students are, since the N.D.A exam is conducted just after 12 board\n            exam, students have to prepare for unit tests, half yearly exams,\n            pre boards, tests in coaching institutes, etc. This drains their\n            time and practice for N.D.A dips severely.\n          </p>\n          <h3 class="text-yellow-500 font-semibold mt-4">\n            Join any coaching class for N.D.A written examination:\n          </h3>\n          <p class="text-white mt-2">\n            This is also a good way to prepare. But today finding a good\n            coaching institute for N.D.A is very hard because 90% institutes\n            providing N.D.A training are the ones that trains for\n            IAS/IPS/UPSC/Govt Exams/Banks,etc. NDA is never their first or\n            highest priority course, it might be UPSC/Bank/Govt Job,etc. but not\n            NDA. NDA is always their additional course that they are selling.\n            They are more interested in earning as much money as they can, from\n            the property/class they have rented/bought. From business\n            perspective they are doing very correct for themselves But from\n            student’s perspective they will surely lack quality as per the\n            saying “JACK of ALL TRADES, MASTER OF NONE”. Rest many Institutes\n            are owned and runned by Ex – Armed Forces officers/personnels, who\n            in todays scenario themselves cannot clear the N.D.A written exams.\n            Reason, they might have worked in Forces for minimum 20 years or\n            more i.e. newest of any such officer would have joined in 1990’s or\n            earlier. Earlier the qualification required was class 10 and before\n            that it was less than that. So, how can a 10 th pass person teach\n            today’s youth for written exam? They can surely help for S.S.B and\n            other stuff but surely not for written. (There is a catch in S.S.B\n            guidance by these institutes as well, Whenever you want guidance for\n            S.S.B always crosscheck whether the Officer there has a background\n            of being Ex-GTO, psychologist or Interviewer in any of the S.S.B\n            earlier. Because these above mentioned officers are the only ones\n            which are trained for S.S.B).\n          </p>\n          <h3 class="text-yellow-500 font-semibold mt-4">\n            Join C.D.C for N.D.A written examination:\n          </h3>\n          <p class="text-white mt-2">\n            This is also a good way to prepare for N.D.A written Exam. Since,\n            C.D.C cater only to Defence Entries Training it has helped it to\n            evolve along with various Defence Entries over a period of time. At\n            C.D.C, we have seen & learned from the changes made in various\n            Defence Entries of Army, Navy, Airforce,Paramilitary (they\n            introduced changes in 2009, 2010,2011,2014,2017 and even more that\n            are expected in near future). Accordingly we have adapted ourselves\n            and are also continuously evolving with the changes. Being\n            specialised means being Focused, thats what we have been towards the\n            Defence Entries. We only cater to Defence Entries Training. We have\n            team of Ex-officers, IITians, Ex-Commandos, Physical Trainers,\n            Engineers,etc who continuously work with students to make there\n            learning easy, interesting and effective. From this year i.e.2017,\n            We have introduced our proprietary LMR technique (we have tested\n            this in 2016 as well) for quick and easy learning, we use gamified\n            learning during schools exams & tests which helped the students to\n            focus on academic exams & also enjoy there NDA goal without being\n            deterred. Our idea is that a candidate has to be constantly\n            motivated and inspired to focus towards his GOAL. We believe every\n            student is different, his strength and weak areas are different So\n            each of them require Different Planning and Approach to clear the\n            Exam. and that is C.D.C’s biggest USP. We help and guide every\n            single student of ours to Chart Out his Plan and Approach to clear\n            the Exam and fulfil his DREAM.\n          </p>\n        </div>',
