  A big step towards gender equality. SC orders centre to allow women in NDA
</h2>
<p class="text-gray-400 mt-1">
  Saying 'gender equality issues cannot be postponed', the Supreme Court said
  women candidates must be allowed to appear for the November 2021 National
  Defence Academy exam.

  The Supreme Court on August 18 ruled that women be allowed to face the
  National Defence Academy (NDA) entrance exam for gaining commission as
  officers in defence services. With this, not only have the doors been thrown
  open for women to gain permanent commission in the Indian Army, Air Force and
  Navy, the decision has long-term ramifications regarding the future of women
  in the armed forces.
</p>
<p class="text-white mt-2">
  At present, women are recruited in the defence services as short service
  commission officers. On March 17, 2020, the Supreme Court ordered women
  officers to be given the same option of converting their short service
  commission to permanent commission—as given to male officers.
</p>
<p class="text-white mt-2">
  The first batch of women officers was given commission in the Navy in 1992. It
  has taken close to 30 years for women to be given direct permanent commission.
  Commander Prasanna Edayilliam (retired), the first woman officer from the
  Indian Navy to challenge the denial of permanent commission to women officers
  in court in 2010, welcomed the decision. “If a woman clears the NDA written
  test, the physical test and outdoor training imparted at the NDA, she ought to
  be treated at par with the men who accomplish the same,” she said. “The idea
  is to groom someone from a young age. A young male is not born an admiral. If
  the same opportunities are given to women, I suppose in 30 years from now,
  India could have its first woman Navy chief.”
</p>
<p class="text-white mt-2">
  To understand what gaining entry into the defence services through the NDA
  means, a look at the various options for entry would be pertinent. The NDA
  recruits personnel right after leaving school. Another mode of entry is
  through the Combined Defence Services (CDS) exam, which is meant for
  graduates. Commissions through both channels are permanent. Besides, there is
  a permanent commission for those who have done their post-graduation, which is
  usually for engineers, electronics and mechanical engineers (EMEs), judge and
  advocate general (JAGs), signals, army educational corps (AECs), etc. The
  Officer Training Academy (OTA) in Chennai and Gaya recruits short service
  commission officers, both men and women. This is presently the only entry
  option available for women.
</p>
<p class="text-white mt-2">
  While recruits and trainees of all academies are at par, on paper, once they
  have passed out, it is the NDA near Pune that is considered the elite
  institution among them. At present, the top positions in the army, navy and
  air force are usually manned by NDA recruits. The reason is simple. NDA
  recruits have an advantage as their entry age is between 16.5 and 19. In
  defence services, where retirement age is tied to the rank held, the youngest
  in a batch have a very clear benefit.
</p>
<p class="text-white mt-2">
  While the nuts and bolts of recruitment of women officers through the NDA is
  to be worked out, what is clear is that women will get permanent commission
  and, as a result, commission in what are called ‘Arms’ or the main fighting
  unit. Promotions in the army also depend on the formation the officer hails
  from. In the case of the army, being from the infantry, artillery or armoured
  corps holds an advantage in promotions as there are more vacancies within the
  formation for officers to rise up the chain. Also, top positions of corps
  commanders or army commanders, and finally the chief, are almost always held
  by those from the ‘Arms’. Gaining entry into the fighting arms will put women
  in the reckoning for all top positions in the army. “That is a possibility in
  the future. Once the commission is permanent, all roles are open for women,”
  says Vice Admiral Suresh Bangara (retired), a former commandant of the NDA.
</p>
<p class="text-white mt-2">
  How will the NDA prepare itself for this historic decision? “The Supreme Court
  saw the issue from the point of equality. Adjustments will have to be made in
  physical infrastructure for women when they arrive at the NDA. Already, with
  enhanced induction levels, the number of squadrons of trainees has been
  increased,” says Bangara.
</p>
<p class="text-white mt-2">
  The three service chiefs visited the NDA on August 20 to take stock of the
  situation and prepare the academy for the arrival of women as trainees on its
  premises.
</p>
<p class="text-white mt-2">
  Even in the west, where women officers in the navy have been given command of
  battleships, the new ships being built are designed in a way that they have
  women-specific amenities. “Some modifications may need to be done. But if
  women have gone to space and conquered Mount Everest, these changes can be
  easily made to facilitate them,” said Prasanna. It is not clear yet how many
  women will make it to the NDA after the written test and other formalities to
  be held November onwards. “Most importantly, we do not want any reservation
  for entry. We want the same training, the same merit as men. There can then be
  no denial of higher commands for women,” she added.

<p class="text-white mt-4">
  The First and Foremost thing you should understand is that NDA written Exam is
  VERY EASY to clear if you plan for it properly. You might have come across
  “NDA written is very TOUGH to crack” “It’s not everyone’s cup of tea“, etc.
  This is all Bullshit. THESE statements are made either by
  people/websites/blogs those who want to sell their Books/Course
  Materials/Courses/Advertisements,etc or by people who have either never ever
  appeared for NDA exam or have never cleared the exam.
</p>
<p class="text-white mt-4">
  You might find above mentioned statement very BOLD but its very true. Let me
  prove it to you, Try to find information of candidates who have cleared the
  NDA written exam, he might be your friend, your friend’s friend, neighbour,
  senior, etc. Ask them their 10th and 12th Board Exam percentage, you will be
  surprised to find maximum of the students will be from 55% – 75% category.
  Students from lower or upper percentage bracket may also have cleared the exam
  but majority comes from this bracket. If the N.D.A written Exam is so TOUGH,
  then how on earth from last so many years 55% or 60% students are clearing the
  written exam. The only reason I can find is, other than having Desire and
  Dream to join NDA and they put in right efforts and right planning in place to
  do so.
</p>
<p class="text-white mt-4">In first 2 para’s, I made 2 points clear:</p>
<ul class="text-white mt-2">
  <li>1. NDA written exam is easy to clear if you plan for it properly.</li>
  <li>2. Anyone can clear the exam</li>
</ul>
<p class="text-white mt-4">
  If you are looking for points, how to prepare for N.D.A Exam, you can click
  here. But this article is about finding the Best way to prepare for NDA
  written Exam.
</p>
<p class="text-white mt-4">
  How i see it, I find 3 ways to prepare for N.D.A written exam
</p>
<ul class="text-white mt-2">
  <li>1. Self Preparation</li>
  <li>2. Join any coaching class.</li>
  <li>3. Join C.D.C.</li>
</ul>
<div class="mt-8 pl-4">
  <h3 class="text-yellow-500 font-semibold">Self Preparation:</h3>
  <p class="text-white mt-2">
    This is one of the good way to prepare. But the commitment level required is
    very high as you have to maintain the same consistency for nearly 2 years.
    On an average student who self prepares for the exam Buy one good book and
    try to finish that book before the exam i.e. prepares from that same book.
    Biggest challenges faced by such students are, since the N.D.A exam is
    conducted just after 12 board exam, students have to prepare for unit tests,
    half yearly exams, pre boards, tests in coaching institutes, etc. This
    drains their time and practice for N.D.A dips severely.
  </p>
  <h3 class="text-yellow-500 font-semibold mt-4">
    Join any coaching class for N.D.A written examination:
  </h3>
  <p class="text-white mt-2">
    This is also a good way to prepare. But today finding a good coaching
    institute for N.D.A is very hard because 90% institutes providing N.D.A
    training are the ones that trains for IAS/IPS/UPSC/Govt Exams/Banks,etc. NDA
    is never their first or highest priority course, it might be UPSC/Bank/Govt
    Job,etc. but not NDA. NDA is always their additional course that they are
    selling. They are more interested in earning as much money as they can, from
    the property/class they have rented/bought. From business perspective they
    are doing very correct for themselves But from student’s perspective they
    will surely lack quality as per the saying “JACK of ALL TRADES, MASTER OF
    NONE”. Rest many Institutes are owned and runned by Ex – Armed Forces
    officers/personnels, who in todays scenario themselves cannot clear the
    N.D.A written exams. Reason, they might have worked in Forces for minimum 20
    years or more i.e. newest of any such officer would have joined in 1990’s or
    earlier. Earlier the qualification required was class 10 and before that it
    was less than that. So, how can a 10 th pass person teach today’s youth for
    written exam? They can surely help for S.S.B and other stuff but surely not
    for written. (There is a catch in S.S.B guidance by these institutes as
    well, Whenever you want guidance for S.S.B always crosscheck whether the
    Officer there has a background of being Ex-GTO, psychologist or Interviewer
    in any of the S.S.B earlier. Because these above mentioned officers are the
    only ones which are trained for S.S.B).
  </p>
  <h3 class="text-yellow-500 font-semibold mt-4">
    Join C.D.C for N.D.A written examination:
  </h3>
  <p class="text-white mt-2">
    This is also a good way to prepare for N.D.A written Exam. Since, C.D.C
    cater only to Defence Entries Training it has helped it to evolve along with
    various Defence Entries over a period of time. At C.D.C, we have seen &
    learned from the changes made in various Defence Entries of Army, Navy,
    Airforce,Paramilitary (they introduced changes in 2009, 2010,2011,2014,2017
    and even more that are expected in near future). Accordingly we have adapted
    ourselves and are also continuously evolving with the changes. Being
    specialised means being Focused, thats what we have been towards the Defence
    Entries. We only cater to Defence Entries Training. We have team of
    Ex-officers, IITians, Ex-Commandos, Physical Trainers, Engineers,etc who
    continuously work with students to make there learning easy, interesting and
    effective. From this year i.e.2017, We have introduced our proprietary LMR
    technique (we have tested this in 2016 as well) for quick and easy learning,
    we use gamified learning during schools exams & tests which helped the
    students to focus on academic exams & also enjoy there NDA goal without
    being deterred. Our idea is that a candidate has to be constantly motivated
    and inspired to focus towards his GOAL. We believe every student is
    different, his strength and weak areas are different So each of them require
    Different Planning and Approach to clear the Exam. and that is C.D.C’s
    biggest USP. We help and guide every single student of ours to Chart Out his
    Plan and Approach to clear the Exam and fulfil his DREAM.

<p class="mt-1 text-white">
  The books you can use to practice for Maths is R S Aggarwal. Time constraint
  is aging the major factor for Maths Section, so it is very important to be
  very careful while attempting the questions. Candidates should have to attempt
  questions where you are pretty sure to avoid the impact of negative marking.
</p>

  Reasoning and General Awareness:
</h3>
<p class="mt-2 text-white">
  Reasoning and General Awareness is applicable for candidates who are appearing

  Reasoning by RS Aggarwal. The level of this book is very good and has ample
  questions to practice under each topic.
</p>
<p class="mt-1 text-white">
  Note: Negative Marking plays a very important role in the elimination criteria
  while solving the questions. In the past exams, we have observed that few
  students who were very good at academics lose the exam by attempting more
  doubtful questions.
</p>
<p class="mt-1 text-white">
  Therefore, you need not be aggressive while solving the paper, have patient
  and answer the questions where you are 100% sure. Attempting a wrong answer
  will take you back from the merit list.
