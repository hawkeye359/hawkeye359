<h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold">What is NDA?</h2>
<p class="mt-10">
  The NDA exam is conducted by UPSC for admission to the Army, Navy and Air
  Force wings of the NDA. This exam is a gateway for candidates looking forward
  to joining Defence Forces including Army, Navy and Air Force. This is a
  national level exam conducted twice a year: NDA I and NDA II to help
  candidates make a career in Defence services.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  The National Defence Academy (NDA) is the Joint Services academy of the Indian
  Armed Forces, where cadets of the three services, the Army, the Navy and the
  Air Force train together before they go on to pre-commissioning training in
  their respective service academies. The NDA is located in Khadakwasla near
  Pune, Maharashtra. It is the first tri-service academy in the world.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  The training at NDA is rigorous. In addition to service training for the Army,
  Navy and AirForce, the cadets are also taught academics to cover the
  graduation level degree in Arts, Sciences or Computers. The training at NDA is
  broken into six terms and the total duration of training is three years. Once
  their training is concluded, the cadets are awarded their bachelor’s degree at
  the passing out parade of NDA. Thereafter the cadets go to their respective
  service institutes i.e. the Indian Military Academy or IMA for army cadets,
  Air Force Academy Hyderabad for Air force cadets and Naval Academy Cochin for
  Naval Cadets.

<h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold">WHAT IS NAVY - SSR / AA?</h2>
<p class="mt-5">
  The Indian Navy is a well-balanced and cohesive three-dimensional force,
  capable of operating above, on and under the surface of the oceans,
  efficiently safeguarding our national interests.
</p>
<p class="mt-2">
  The Chief of the Naval Staff (CNS) exercises operational and administrative
  control of the Indian Navy from the Integrated Headquarters of Ministry of
  Defence (Navy). He is assisted by the Vice Chief of the Naval Staff (VCNS) and
  three other Principal Staff Officers, namely the Deputy Chief of the Naval
  Staff (DCNS), the Chief of Personnel (COP) and the Chief of Material (COM).
</p>
<p class="mt-7">
  The Navy has the following three Commands, each under the control of a Flag
  Officer Commanding-in-Chief:-
</p>
<p class="mt-2">
  <b
    >The Western Naval Command (Headquarters at Mumbai). <br />
    The Eastern Naval Command (Headquarters at Visakhapatnam). <br />
    The Southern Naval Command (Headquarters at Kochi)</b
  >
</p>
<p class="mt-4">
  The Western and the Eastern Naval Commands are ‘Operational Commands’, and
  exercise control over operations in the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal
  respectively. The Southern Command is the Training Command.
</p>
<p class="mt-4">
  The cutting edge of the Indian Navy are its two Fleets, namely the Western
  Fleet, based at Mumbai and the Eastern Fleet, based at Visakhapatnam. Besides
  the Fleets, there is a Flotilla each, based at Mumbai, Visakhapatnam and Port
  Blair (A & N Islands), that provide Local Naval Defence in their respective
  regions. Naval ships are also based at other ports along the East and the West
  coasts of India and the island territories, thus ensuring continued naval
  presence in the areas of national interest. Further, there are various Naval
  Officer-in-Charges (NOICs), under each Command, responsible for the Local
  Naval Defence of ports under their respective jurisdictions.
</p>
<p class="mt-4">
  The defence of the Andaman & Nicobar Islands is a joint responsibility of all
  the three services and is coordinated by the Headquarters, Andaman & Nicobar
  Command, located at PortBlair. This is the only Tri-ServicesCommand in the
  Indian Armed Forces and is headed by a Commander-in-Chief, as appointed in
  rotation from the three Services. The Local Naval Defence of the Lakshadweep
  group of islands is the responsibility of the Naval Officer-in-Charge,
  Lakshadweep.
